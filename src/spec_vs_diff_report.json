As a result, the requested transparency fix and the constraint to keep the same ValentinePage asset reference cannot be verified as implemented from this diff.",

      "requirement": "Update the decorative heart icon image used on the page shown after clicking the “Yes” button (ValentinePage) so the icon background is fully transparent (no visible box/solid background).",
