# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the decorative heart icon image on the post-“Yes” ValentinePage render with a fully transparent background so it blends cleanly with the page background.

**Planned changes:**
- Edit the existing heart icon asset to remove any solid/boxed background and preserve clean transparency.
- Keep ValentinePage layout and its existing image reference unchanged (same src path, sizing, and spacing).

**User-visible outcome:** After clicking “Yes,” the ValentinePage heart icons appear without any visible rectangular background in both light and dark mode overlays.
